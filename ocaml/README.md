# Beer Song

Our goal is to produce the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite: 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.

You can find the full lyrics @ [`dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/SONG_LYRICS.md`](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/blob/master/SONG_LYRICS.md).

## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

* Remove as much duplication as you possibly can.
* Optimize for readability, even if it means introducing duplication.
* If you've removed all the duplication, do you have a lot of
  conditionals? Try replacing the conditionals with polymorphism, if it
  applies in this language. How readable is it?

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?


## Getting Started
For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ocaml).

## Installation
To work on the exercises, you will need `Opam` and `Core`. Consult [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) website for instructions on how to install `opam` for your OS. Once `opam` is installed open a terminal window and run the following command to install core:

```bash
opam install core
```

To run the tests you will need `OUnit`. Install it using `opam`:

```bash
opam install ounit
```

## Running Tests
A Makefile is provided with a default target to compile your solution and run the tests. At the command line, type:

```bash
make
```

## Interactive Shell
`utop` is a command line program which allows you to run Ocaml code interactively. The easiest way to install it is via opam:
```bash
opam install utop
```
Consult [utop](https://github.com/diml/utop/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests
The [exercism/ocaml](https://github.com/exercism/ocaml) repository on
GitHub is the home for all of the Ocaml exercises.

If you have feedback about an exercise, or want to help implementing a new
one, head over there and create an issue.  We'll do our best to help you!
