# Beer song

99 Bottles of Beer is an algorithmic children's song which has just enough complexity to teach you deep truths about object oriented programming.

Our goal is to produce the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite. You can find them @ [`dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/SONG_LYRICS.md`](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/blob/master/SONG_LYRICS.md).

## Installation

See [this guide](https://github.com/exercism/xr/blob/master/docs/INSTALLATION.md) for instructions on how to setup your local R environment.

## How to implement your solution

In each problem folder, there is a file named `<exercise_name>.R` containing a function that returns a `NULL` value. Place your implementation inside the body of the function.

## How to run tests

Inside of RStudio, simply execute the `test_<exercise_name>.R` script. This can be conveniently done with [testthat's `auto_test` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/testthat/topics/auto_test). Because exercism code and tests are in the same folder, use this same path for both  `code_path` and `test_path` parameters. On the command-line, you can also run `Rscript test_<exercise_name>.R`.
