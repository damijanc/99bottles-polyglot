# Beer song

99 Bottles of Beer is an algorithmic children's song which has just enough complexity to teach you deep truths about object oriented programming.

Our goal is to produce the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite. You can find them @ [`dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/SONG_LYRICS.md`](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/blob/master/SONG_LYRICS.md).

## Setup

There are two different methods of getting set up to run the tests with Objective-C:

- Create an Xcode project with a test target which will run the tests.
- Use the ruby gem `objc` as a test runner utility.

Both are described in more detail here: http://exercism.io/languages/objective-c
