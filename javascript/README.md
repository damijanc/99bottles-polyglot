# Beer song

99 Bottles of Beer is an algorithmic children's song which has just enough complexity to teach you deep truths about object oriented programming.

Our goal is to produce the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite. You can find them @ [`dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/SONG_LYRICS.md`](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/blob/master/SONG_LYRICS.md).

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

```sh
  jasmine beer-song.spec.js
```    

Notice that all but the first test have been skipped. Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by changing `xit` to `it`.
