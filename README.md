# Workshop: What is good code?

This repository contains the initial test suite in a bunch of programming languages. Here's what you would need to do in order to get up & running:

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the directory containing the initial test suite for your language of choice
3. Run the tests (output should be along the lines of “1 failed, n skipped”)
4. Please, let me know if you:
  - Run into any problem during the previous steps, or...
  - ... are ready to go.
5. Happy hacking! ;)
