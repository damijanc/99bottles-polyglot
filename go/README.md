# Beer song

99 Bottles of Beer is an algorithmic children's song which has just enough complexity to teach you deep truths about object oriented programming.

Our goal is to produce the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite. You can find them @ [`dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/SONG_LYRICS.md`](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/blob/master/SONG_LYRICS.md).

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.
