# Beer song

99 Bottles of Beer is an algorithmic children's song which has just enough complexity to teach you deep truths about object oriented programming.

Our goal is to produce the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite. You can find them @ [`dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/SONG_LYRICS.md`](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/blob/master/SONG_LYRICS.md).

## Running the test suite

For running the provided tests, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise
directory:

    ruby beer_song_test.rb

To include color from the command line:

    ruby -r minitest/pride beer_song_test.rb
