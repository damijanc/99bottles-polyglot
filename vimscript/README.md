# Beer song

99 Bottles of Beer is an algorithmic children's song which has just enough complexity to teach you deep truths about object oriented programming.

Our goal is to produce the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite. You can find them @ [`dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/SONG_LYRICS.md`](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/blob/master/SONG_LYRICS.md).
